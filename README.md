# Advent of Code 2025

Welcome to my solutions repository for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)! This repository will serve as a collection of my daily code submissions as I work through each programming puzzle throughout December.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event that delivers a new programming challenge every day from December 1st through December 25th. These challenges are designed to be fun, thought-provoking, and rewarding for coders of all levels.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

```
.
|-- Day1/
|   |-- p1.py
|   |-- p2.py
|-- Day2/
|   |-- p1.py
|   |-- p2.py
...
|-- README.md
```

### Folder Contents:
- **`Dayxx`**: Each day's folder contains:
  - `px.*`: My solution implementation, written in Python (p1 for problem one, p2 for problem 2).

## Goals
- Solve each day's puzzle before the end of the day.
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
- Explore and learn new algorithms, data structures, or techniques when needed.

## Feedback and Contributions
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you spot any errors or have suggestions for improvement. This is a personal learning project, but collaboration is always welcome!

Happy coding, and may the puzzles be ever in your favor! ðŸŽ„
